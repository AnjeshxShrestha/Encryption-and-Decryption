# 🔐 Advanced AES Encryption & Decryption in Python

This project provides a simple yet advanced AES encryption and decryption tool using Python. It uses **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** in **CBC mode** with **PKCS7 padding**, allowing users to securely encrypt and decrypt text using a password key.

## 🛠 Features

- AES-256 encryption in CBC mode
- Secure IV (Initialization Vector) generation
- Base64 encoding for encrypted output
- Encryption and decryption with the same script
- Easy-to-use command-line interface

## 🚀 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library

Install the required library:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
